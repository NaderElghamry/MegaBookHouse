<p>Textbooks will be available for purchase online 2 weeks prior to the start of the semester.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Can I rent textbooks online?</p>
<p>Yes! If your textbook is available as a rental, a price for "new rental" or "used rental" will appear on the selection screen. Add the desired item to your cart. You must agree to the rental terms before you can complete your transaction.</p>
<p></p>
<p>When do rental books have to be returned, and what are the penalty fees?</p>
<p>Textbook rentals must be returned 2 WEEKS AFTER THE END OF THE SEMESTER to avoid penalty fees. Books not returned by the deadline date will be charged to the customer at full retail price.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Why can't I add the book to my cart? (Price not displayed or grayed out)</p>
<p>If prices do not display or are grayed out, the book has not arrived from the publisher. Inventory is updated daily, so please check the website again later.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Why can't I find the ISBN on Amazon?</p>
<p>Your instructor may have chosen a special customized textbook which is not available from other retailers.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Can I purchase a digital book?</p>
<p>Yes, many titles are available in digital format from our online affiliates. You will see them listed along with other versions of the book, when available.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Why do you show prices from other online retailers?</p>
<p>Our website now has a new feature - it's called comparison shopping. After you create a course list you will see prices for your books from the SAC Don Bookstore as well as other online retailers. If you purchase from another retailer, you will be directed to that retailer's website to complete your transaction.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Can I pick up the books in person?</p>
<p>Yes - choose "In-Store Pickup" as your shipping method. There is no charge for this service, and you can pick up the books at our Pickup counter. After you receive your "Ready for Pickup" email from us, bring your order number and a photo ID to the bookstore. Call (714) 564-6435 for current store hours.</p>
<p>When will my order be ready?</p>
<p>You will know your order is ready for pickup after you receive your second email, showing "Ready for Pickup". Bring your photo ID and web order confirmation number to the pickup counter. Most orders are processed in 24 business hours (Monday-Friday only).</p>
<p></p>
<p>How will I know my order is ready for pickup?</p>
<p>You will receive a second email when your order is ready. You can also log in to your account from our website to check your order status. When the status says Complete or Shipped, your order is ready at the bookstore.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Can I have the books shipped to me?</p>
<p>Yes - choose "USPS 1-3 Day Delivery" during the checkout process. Shipping costs $10.00 for the first item, and $2.00 for each additional item. Shipping takes about 1-4 business days. We are not able to send USPS tracking numbers, but you can log into your account on our website to check your order status.</p>
<p></p>
<p>How will I know my order has been shipped?</p>
<p>You will receive an email from the Don Bookstore when we have processed your order. You can also check your order status by logging in to your account from our website.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Why am I being charged more than the total on my order confirmation?</p>
<p>The total charged to your credit card may be adjusted based on inventory quantities of new or used books at the time your order is processed.</p>
<p></p>
<p>What if I forget to pick up my books?</p>
<p>If you do not pick up your web order within 21 days of the order being placed your order will be considered abandoned. The Campus Store will make at least one attempt via email, to contact the customer about picking up their order. Abondoned orders can be refunded by customer request if: the request is made within the first 21 days of class start. After this period, a gift card can be issued for the refund.</p>

<p>My class is at Santiago Canyon College. Can I buy the book from the Don Bookstore?</p>
<p>No. Different campuses use different books, so make sure to purchase your books at the campus where your class is held. Books for Santiago Canyon College classes can be purchased from their website at: HawkBookstore.com</p>
<p></p>
<p>Why are my books so expensive?</p>
<p>The Hawk Bookstore sells new and used textbooks at a price designed to cover the costs of operating the bookstore and meeting all other required financial obligations. This price includes all expenses associated with bookstore operations and personnel. We are 100% nonprofit.</p>

<p>Why can't I sell my book back to the Bookstore?</p>
<p>If we cannot buy back your textbook, it is for one of the following reasons</p>
<ol type="1" >
<li>The instructor has requested a different book than was used last semester</li>
<li>The course has been dropped from the curriculum</li>
<li>We already have a full quota of books for the course</li>
<li>The publisher has advised us of a forthcoming new edition</li>
<li>The textbook has gone out of print</li>
<li>The textbook is in poor condition (water damage, etc.)</li>
<li>The course is offered only once a year or every other year</li>
<li>We have not received a request from faculty to provide the book</li>
<li>We cannot buy back tapes, computer software, or workbooks</li>
</ol>
<p>NOTE:As a courtesy to students,
 the Bookstore will provide for a used book wholesaler,
 Nebraska Book Co., to make you an offer on most of the books the Bookstore cannot buy.
 You will get the best price for your books during finals week,
 because our need is greatest at that time.</p>
<p></p>
